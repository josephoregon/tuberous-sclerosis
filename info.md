<summary>What is Tuberous Sclerosis?</summary>

Tuberous sclerosis (also called tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC) is a <b><u>rare, multi-system genetic disease</u></b> that causes non-cancerous (benign) tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. It usually affects the central nervous system and can result in a combination of symptoms including seizures, impaired intellectual development, autism, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and kidney disease.

The severity of symptoms varies widely. Symptoms range from mild—allowing people to live independent, productive lives—to more severe symptoms that can affect everyday life and even be life-threatening. Many people with TSC show evidence of the disorder in the first year of life. However, clinical features can be subtle initially, and many signs and symptoms take years to develop. As a result, TSC can be unrecognized or misdiagnosed for years.

The name tuberous sclerosis comes from the characteristic tuber or potato-like nodules in the brain, which calcify with age and become hard or sclerotic. TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders.
