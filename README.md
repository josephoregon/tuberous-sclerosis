<b>What is Tuberous Sclerosis?</b>
<p>
Tuberous sclerosis (also called tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC) is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that causes non-cancerous (benign) tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. It usually affects the central nervous system and can result in a combination of symptoms including seizures, impaired intellectual development, autism, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and kidney disease.

  <b>Cortical Tubers</b>
  <br />
Cortical tubers in the brain are hamartomatous lesions typically located at the gray-white matter interface, commonly in the frontal and parietal lobes. Cortical tubers are composed of abnormal glial and neural cells, and the size, number, and location vary among patients.

  <b>Hypomelanotic Macule</b>
  <br />
Hypomelanotic macules ("ash leaf spots") are white or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of melanin. White ash leaf-shaped macules are considered to be characteristic of tuberous sclerosis.

<p>
  <b>Subependymal Nodules</b>
  <br />
Small nodular masses which originate in the subependymal region of the lateral ventricles and protrude into the ventricular cavity. They may represent subependymal hamartomas of tuberous sclerosis or nodular heterotopia of grey matter.
